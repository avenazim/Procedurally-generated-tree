This project is a source code for my engineering diploma thesis titled:

### ***"VEGETATION GENERATION METHODS FOR COMPUTER GAMES AND VIZUALIZATIONS WITH LOW COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY"***
<br />

#### **Abstract**
 
The usage of procedural generation in creating games is a popular solution these days, mostly due to the size of a game and loading time reduction and also expansion of possibilities from the player’s perspective. Manual creation of every single element goes out of date and instead the game is allowed to generate it’s own content. Own method of generating procedural trees with the use of vector graphics was presented as a part of this diploma thesis. Thanks to low computing power the outcome can be used either in browser games or in widely understood computer visualisations. Description of tools and programms used for this project along with the creation process and possible alternatives was also introduced.
